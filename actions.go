// Action is the generic type of all state machine transitions, formalized to better allow external agents to interact with the game.
// For all Actions, g is the game in which it is performed and pn is the player number performing the action.
// data represents different things for different Actions.
//
// If pn is valid, Actions are guaranteed to not modify the internal state of g at all, and return a descriptive
// error if the attempted action was illegal.
//
// Passing an invalid player number to pn will result in undefined behavior,
// and may cause anything from a segmentation fault to completely silent failure.
// Invalid player numbers are player numbers that have not been assigned to a player within Game g.
// Player numbers that have left the game *may* still be valid (but cannot legally perform actions), but
// that is not guaranteed by the API. Player numbers are generally meant as an internal identifier,
// and in most applications will be mapped to some other identifier (like a client session id), so
// it intentionally does not perform checks on the values it is passed to
// optimize performance. If you intend to pass Actions player numbers directly from an external source
// it is your responsibility to ensure the integrity of those numbers.
